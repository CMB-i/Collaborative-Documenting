# Collaborative-Documenting
A Google Docsâ€“style platform that allows multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously, with integrated AI-powered writing tools such as summarization, grammar suggestions, and tone adjustments. The project aims to merge collaborative editing (powered by CRDTs or OT algorithms) with real-time AI augmentation for productivity.
